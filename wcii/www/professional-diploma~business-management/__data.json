Plagiarism, which is the presentation of another person’s thoughts or words as though they were your own, must be avoided with particular care in coursework, essays, and reports. If a student is found guilty of plagiarism, his/her assignment will not be marked at all.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Many students feel pressured to complete papers well and quickly, and with the accessibility of new technology (the Internet) students can plagiarize by copying and pasting information from other sources. This is often easily detected by teachers, for several reasons. First, students’ choice of sources is frequently unoriginal; instructors may receive the same passage copied from a popular source from several students. Second, it is often easy to tell whether students used their own “words.” Third, students may choose sources that are inappropriate, off-topic, or contain incorrect information. In the academic world, plagiarism by students is a very serious offense that can result in punishments such as a failing grade on a particular assignment (typically at the college or university level).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>WCII is using software (Plagiarism Checker).
